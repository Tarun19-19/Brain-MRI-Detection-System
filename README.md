# Brain MRI Tumor Classification — Three-Model Comparison

A PyTorch benchmark comparing three architectures on brain MRI tumor classification: a CNN trained from scratch, and two transfer-learning models (ResNet18, MobileNetV3-Small) with frozen backbones. All three are trained under identical conditions (same data splits, optimizer, schedule, and epoch budget) so their results are directly comparable.

## Classes

The dataset is a 4-class brain MRI classification task:

- `glioma`
- `meningioma`
- `notumor`
- `pituitary`

## Models compared

| Model | Type | Trainable params |
|---|---|---|
| **Custom CNN** (`BrainCNN`) | Trained from scratch — 4 conv blocks (32→64→128→256 channels) with BatchNorm, ReLU, MaxPool, global average pool, dropout(0.4) head | All layers |
| **ResNet18** | Transfer learning — ImageNet-pretrained backbone frozen, final `fc` layer replaced and fine-tuned | Final layer only |
| **MobileNetV3-Small** | Transfer learning — ImageNet-pretrained backbone frozen, final classifier layer replaced and fine-tuned | Final layer only |

## Results (50 epochs, held-out test set)

| Model | Test Accuracy | Precision (macro) | Recall (macro) | F1 (macro) | Mean Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Custom CNN** | **89.88%** | 90.81% | 89.88% | 89.61% | 0.853 |
| ResNet18 | 85.81% | 86.14% | 85.81% | 85.48% | 0.782 |
| MobileNetV3-Small | 84.62% | 85.72% | 84.62% | 84.10% | 0.811 |

The from-scratch CNN outperformed both frozen-backbone transfer-learning models on this run, likely because only the final layer was fine-tuned for ResNet18/MobileNetV3 — the frozen ImageNet features aren't fully adapted to MRI-specific textures. Unfreezing more layers (or fine-tuning the full backbone at a lower learning rate) is a natural next experiment; see [Notes & possible improvements](#notes--possible-improvements).

Per-epoch metrics, confusion matrices, and dashboard plots are generated for every model — see [Outputs](#outputs).

```

`Training/` and `Testing/` must each contain one subfolder per class (standard `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` layout), and both must expose the same four class folders.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- CUDA-capable GPU (the notebook raises an error if CUDA isn't visible — see [GPU memory management](#gpu-memory-management) for why)
- PyTorch with CUDA support, matching your installed CUDA toolkit
- `torchvision`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `Pillow`

```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121  # match to your CUDA version
pip install numpy matplotlib pillow
```

> The notebook was developed against a Windows virtualenv (`DL Project (PyTorch cu130)` kernel); the CUDA build/version isn't load-bearing for the code itself — just point the kernel at any Python environment with a matching CUDA-enabled PyTorch install.

## Running

1. Place `Training/` and `Testing/` folders (ImageFolder layout, see above) beside the notebook.
2. Run cells in this order:
   1. **Setup cell** — imports, seeding, CUDA check, dataset/dataloader creation.
   2. **Preprocessing inspection cell** — prints the augmentation pipeline and class distribution, shows a sample augmented batch.
   3. **Model definitions cell** — defines `BrainCNN` and builds all three models (`models_to_train` dict), keeps everything on CPU until training.
   4. **Shared training-functions cell** — defines `metrics_from_predictions`, `evaluate_model`, `show_live_dashboard`, `save_metrics_json`, and a baseline `train_one_model`.
   5. **GPU-safe trainer override cell** — replaces `train_one_model` with a version that keeps only the active model on the GPU and uses mixed precision. **Must run after step 4 and before the three algorithm cells below.**
   6. **Algorithm 1 — Custom CNN** (50 epochs)
   7. **Algorithm 2 — ResNet18** (50 epochs)
   8. **Algorithm 3 — MobileNetV3** (50 epochs)
3. Run the **evaluation/comparison cell** to print classification reports, plot confusion matrices, per-model training curves, and a 3-model comparison grid across accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confidence, uncertainty, and learning rate.
4. Use `predict_brain_mri(image_path, model_name)` to run inference on a single image with any of the three trained models still held in memory.

## Training configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Epochs | 50 |
| Optimizer | Adam, weight_decay=1e-4 |
| Learning rate | 1e-3, with `ReduceLROnPlateau` (factor 0.5, patience 3, min 1e-6) |
| Loss | Cross-entropy with label smoothing (0.1) |
| Gradient clipping | max norm 1.0 |
| Batch size | 16 |
| Image size | 224×224 |
| Train augmentation | resize → random horizontal flip → random rotation (±10°) → color jitter (brightness/contrast 0.15) → normalize (ImageNet mean/std) |
| Test augmentation | resize → normalize only |
| Seed | 42 (Python, NumPy, PyTorch, CUDA) |
| Precision | Mixed precision (`torch.amp`) on CUDA |

## GPU memory management

The notebook is written for an **8 GB GPU** and trains three models in sequence rather than in parallel: before each model's training loop starts, every *other* model in `models_to_train` is moved to CPU, and only the active model is moved to CUDA, followed by `gc.collect()` + `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`. This keeps peak VRAM usage to one model at a time even though all three live in memory for the later comparison/inference cells.

## Outputs

Each run creates a unique folder under `saved_models/run_<timestamp>_<8-char-uuid>/` containing, per model:

- `<model>_epoch_<NNN>.png` — a 4-panel live dashboard (loss, accuracy, precision/recall/F1, confusion matrices) saved after every epoch
- `<model>_<run_id>_metrics.json` — full per-epoch history (all metrics, both confusion matrices, learning rate) after every epoch
- `<model>_<run_id>_best.pth` — the model checkpoint with the best test accuracy seen during training (`model_state_dict`, `class_names`, `image_size`, `model_name`, `run_id`)
- `<model>_<run_id>_complete_history.png` — final 6-panel training-curve summary (from the comparison cell)

Plus, once all three models finish:

- `all_models_<run_id>_metrics.json` — combined history for all three models
- `all_models_<run_id>_comparison.png` — side-by-side comparison across all three models for every tracked metric

## Inference

```python
prediction, confidence = predict_brain_mri(
    "path/to/some_mri_image.jpg",
    model_name="ResNet18",  # or "Custom CNN" / "MobileNetV3"
)
```

Displays the image with the predicted class and confidence, and returns `(predicted_class: str, confidence: float)`. Any of the three trained models can be selected by name as long as they're still loaded in `models_to_train`.

## Notes & possible improvements

- Only the final layer of ResNet18 and MobileNetV3 is fine-tuned (backbone frozen) — unfreezing the last few backbone blocks, or the whole network at a lower LR, is a likely way to close the gap with the from-scratch CNN.
- `NUM_WORKERS = 0` for the dataloaders — increasing this can speed up data loading on multi-core machines.
- Class imbalance isn't explicitly corrected for (no weighted sampler / weighted loss) beyond label smoothing; worth checking per-class support in the classification report if a specific class underperforms.
- Reported metrics (precision/recall/F1) are macro-averaged across all four classes.
